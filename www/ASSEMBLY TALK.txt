	DOSSEG 							//a reserve word
	.MODEL SMALL 						//can have 64k of data, variables, etc.
	.STACK 100h 						//a stack of 256 bytes, reserve enough space
	.DATA 							//anything after .DATA is data declaration
ALPHA db "Hello World", 13, 10,	'$' //with next line		//A STRING is terminated by a DOLLAR
BETA db "I like ARCHORG$"					//w/o $ sign -> garbage value
CRLF db 13, 10, "$"
TANONG db "What is your name?$ "
; SAGOT db "$$$$$$$$$$$$$$"					//One way to allocate 10 bytes for the answer, +4 for other used bytes
								// When allocating space for something, add + 4 bytes
SAGOT db 14 dup("$")						//one way to allocate space
OUTPUT db "Hello $"
								//db = define byte
								//j db 05 -> an address named j with initialization of number 05
